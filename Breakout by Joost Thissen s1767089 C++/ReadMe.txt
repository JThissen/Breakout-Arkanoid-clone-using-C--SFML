**Welcome to Breakout!**
(by Joost Thissen s1767089)

To play the game:
1. Click on the Breakout folder
2. head into the Debug folder
3. Double click on SFML template.exe

To open the solution (code):
1. head into the SFML template folder
2. double click on SFML template.sln (main file)

Use the arrow keys (left & right) to move the paddle.
Whenever all the blocks are destroyed (total: 90), you completed the level and thus finished the game.

Note that the game includes a graphics library <SFML\Graphics.hpp> to render the graphics. 
For more info see: https://www.sfml-dev.org/

Future versions of the game will make use of the Box2D library to include physics when a block is destroyed.
